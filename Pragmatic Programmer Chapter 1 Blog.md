#Pragmatic Programmer Chapter 1

This Chapter went over three things:

##The Cat Ate My Source Code

This went over the concept that pragmatic programmers don't try to make excuses but instead make options. 

##Software Entropy

This section enphasised the importance to fix small problems that arise instead of ignoring them, thus making the problem become worse rather quickly. It tells that just like when a small problem appears that people are quick to ignore it or contribute to the problem. Just as people are likely to keep something from getting messy if it is in prime condition even in the face of looming doom. 

##Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs

This section tells of how it is easier to get people to get on board with a big change if they are shown how well the finished product will be and a reasonable offering they can contribute. It also explains how we need to keep the end result in mind when making changes to projects. If we make too many changes too quickly many people will lose sight of what they were originally trying to make and will get a finished project that is completely different from what they wanted. 

##Good-Enough Software

This section explains about the importance of getting your users opinion on the product before deciding that it is "good enough." Meaning that you should find out what someone wants from their software as you build it so that it meets their wants and you are aware of the limitations you have on the code you write for it. It highlights people's tendencies to want to go above and beyond for the user and don't know when they should stop improving the code because it may be good as it is. 

##Your Knowledge Portfolio

This section goes over the fact that though eperience and knowledge are great things to have. Not keeping your knowledge updated for recent and relevant things can have an impact on how valuable that knowledge is to employers and such. It says that to keep your "portfolio" up to date you must 

1. Invest Regularly
	Make it a habit to consistantly keep gaining new knowledge regardless of how much it is

2. Diversify
	The more things you know the better. It says to know what you need and then some to make you stand out. And the more broad your knowledge the easier it will be for you to adjust to change

3. Manage Risk
	Simpily don't miss out on oppurtunities becasue you didn't want to take a risk but also don't take too many risks and get no payout.

4. Buy low, sell High
	Seek out any relevant information because you never know when it may start to trend.

5. Review and rebalance
	Try not to get caught up in the future and look over some of the things from the past that you may not remeber so well anymore. 

With that in mind it went over the need to continue learning even if the new knowledge never gets used. It would be better to be prepared then to have to binge learn things on the fly. It also goes to say that if you are asked something that you don't know; You should go and find the answer to the question either yourself or through some other means. And finally this section advices to critize things that you discover so that you don't blindly accept things just because of its status. 

##Communicate

Finally this chapter goes over the need to communicate effectively. It gives steps to communicate such as outlining what you are going to say and refine this outline until you feel that you are going to get your point across. It details that you will want to know your audience when formulating your way of getting the message across thus being able to adhear to each group's desires to get them more interested in the information you are giving. Also make sure that you give your message at an appropriate time so that it will be recieved well. Make sure that you know how long or short your message should be so that you are giving the recipient something that they will want to read. Also make sure that your written messges are styled so that they look good and get the desired message across. 

**_And that concludes my findings in Chapter 1_**
